# `@harnyk/chan` - Go channels for TypeScript

This package is my humble attempt to provide a `Chan<T>` class for TypeScript, which would be as much as possible similar to Go's `chan T` type.

## Installation

`npm install @harnyk/chan`

## Usage

See the [tests](./src/chan.test.ts) and [examples](./src/examples) for more information.
